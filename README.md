# Gatherly — AI Coding Workshop Product 

Gatherly is a realistic conference-management product. Attendees discover and register for conferences, then build a personal agenda. Organizers manage programs and capacity, speakers see their sessions, and administrators govern platform access.

The repository is a **working vertical slice plus an approved product backlog**: authentication, authorization, discovery, registration, schedules, and personal agendas work.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 LTS (minimum supported version: 22.12)
- npm 11 or the npm version bundled with Node
- Git 2.40+
- Chrome, Edge, or Firefox
- Recommended: VS Code, Angular Language Service, ESLint, and Prettier
- Optional: Docker Desktop 4.30+

No external database is required. Node's built-in SQLite driver creates a local database automatically.

```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4200`. The API is at `http://localhost:3000`; health check: `GET /api/health`.

The first API start creates and seeds `apps/api/data/gatherly.db`. To restore seed data, stop the API, delete that file, and restart.

## Demo accounts

All accounts use `Workshop123!`.

3. Schedule conflict detection for rooms, speakers, and attendee agendas
4. Waitlist with automatic promotion
5. QR tickets, staff check-in, and live attendance
6. Email/in-app notifications for registrations and schedule changes
7. Paid ticket types, promo codes, refunds, and payment webhooks
8. Session ratings, conference feedback, and analytics
9. Calendar export, timezone handling, and accessibility audit
10. Production hardening: refresh cookies, revocation, rate limits, audit logs, migrations, observability

## Security boundary

Route guards improve UX but are not trusted security. Every protected operation is authorized again in the API. Demo secrets and localStorage tokens are workshop conveniences; production hardening is explicitly part of the backlog.
